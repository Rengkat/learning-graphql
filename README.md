# Project Management App Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for a Project Management App. The project was developed as a learning exercise to understand and work with **GraphQL** using **Node.js** and **Express.js**.

## Features

The backend includes the following functionality:
- **Add Project**: Create new projects in the system.
- **Add Client**: Create new clients associated with projects.
- **Update**: Modify existing project or client details.
- **Delete**: Remove projects or clients from the system.

### Structure
- **Models**: Data models for both projects and clients.
- **Schemas**: GraphQL schemas defining the structure and operations for projects and clients.

## Technology Stack

The backend was built using the following technologies:
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Lightweight web framework for managing routes and middleware.
- **GraphQL**: Query language and runtime for APIs to enable flexible data fetching.

## Prerequisites for Standardization

To make this project more robust and aligned with standard practices, consider implementing the following:

1. **Database Integration**:
   - Use a database like MongoDB to persist project and client data.
   - Add validation logic at the model level.

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement a centralized error handling mechanism to standardize GraphQL error responses.

4. **API Documentation**:
   - Use tools like GraphQL Playground for API documentation and exploration.

5. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Store environment variables in a `.env` file to secure database credentials, API keys, and configuration details.

6. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for GraphQL resolvers and integration tests for the API using frameworks like Jest or Mocha.

8. **Data Validations**:
   - Add input validations using libraries GraphQL input types to ensure data integrity.

9. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the app to platforms like render 
   - Set up CI/CD pipelines for smooth deployments.
